/**
 * @author Edward Zhang
 * 
 * This blockchain demo simulates the operation of the multi-node block chain by implementing the consensus algorithm and storage strategy.
 * Based on multi-thread, StatesChange determines whether the running server can change its state of leader, follower and candidate.
 * Each server runs only one state at any given time and the Timer will count down when the state is follower and candidate.
 * 
 * The problem confuses me is the balance between the peak performance and the latency. Hope it will be solved on the next version.
 * The notes are given to the specific lines and the beginning part of each class.
 * Good luck and welcome to this project.
